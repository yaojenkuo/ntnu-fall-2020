## Additional Registration Policy

Due to resourse constraint and limited experience, we accept limited additional registrations and the priority would be:

1. Senior or graduate student in the last year;
2. Junior or graduate student;
3. Others.

We will probably rely on Python's `random` module to draw if there are too many additional registrations within higher priorities. Auditing is welcomed, however there will be no credits, homeworks, nor exams.
